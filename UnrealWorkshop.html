        <p>
            This project was created over a 4 week period using Unreals workshop as a guide, including other smaller
            guides found on the internet.

        <p>
            First week was to learn how to use the third person template and basic blueprints. I decided to add an
            avatar
            downloaded from Mixamo and learn how to use the animation blueprint for basic movement including a roll.
            Final
            addition for the week I added a grapple hook and basic ragdoll physics.

        <p>
            This week started off with adding pickups that do something when the user walked into the trigger box, for
            this
            example I changed the jump height of the character on pickup. The largest addition was the use of event
            dispatchers to cause events to trigger throughout the blueprints. Finally, I added a trigger to the fire
            particle system from the starter content to trigger when a character walked inside the range and set the
            character on fire.<br><br>

            This week had to be cut short to allow for some planning for the upcoming game jam.

        <p>
            Week 3 started with adding menu systems to the game such as a main menu and a pause menu. Once the menus
            were in
            the environment was looking very plain so I decided to look into the foliage tool and landscape materials.
            This
            is where I learned how to create a procedural terrain painter that worked of the angle of the ground. Using
            the
            materials for the terrain I could also add small foliage that only spawned on the green land.<br><br>

            Lastly for the week was to add a Hud with health and a scoring system using the coins.

        Week 4

        <p>
            This week was all about AI, following the mini course I created a basic twin stick shooter. During this I
            learnt
            how to use blackboard, behaviour trees and AI components. I created a basic AI that would chase the player
            wherever he is on the map. On contact the enemy would do damage to the player who would die after a certain
            amount of damage was sustained.
