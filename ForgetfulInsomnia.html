        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Forgetful Insomnia was created over a couple weeks of a game jam hosted by Grads in Games. We were given a
            very basic project to work with that included and A* search algorithem, tile based grid generation,
            character models, a few terrain objects and a main menu. Our task was to make a playable game using the
            assets we were given using the Unity Engine. This game jam was a solo creation.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        These textures were created for a fire VFX explosion in UE4, the black has been added to make the texture
        more visible, normally they would be transparent.
