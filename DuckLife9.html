        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>
            I designed, created and implemented a Sims-like AI for ducks in our latest released game called Duck Life 9.
            These ducks must manage their 4 needs – happiness, hunger, toilet and sleepiness – while also helping the
            player build the world they design. They also take frequent social breaks to teach eachother skills and to
            become friends. Additionally I was responsible for creating gameplay mechanics, levels, and UI. This also
            includes getting the steam API integrated (cloud saving and achievements), helping with design briefs, and
            responding to user feedback so we could further improve our game.
