        <h4>Photoshop Art</h4>
        <p>
            This is where examples of my artwork with photoshop are shown, these have been made using reference art
            pieces.

        <h4>2D Art</h4>
        <p>
            I wanted to expand on my skills with photoshop for games so I decided to research 2D background art and
            single pane images that could be used for title screens. After following some tutorials and finding some
            images I wanted to see if I could recreate some of the artwork I'd seen during my research. These are the
            results.

        <h4>VFX Textures</h4>
        <p>
            These textures were created for a fire VFX explosion in UE4, the black has been added to make the texture
            more visible, normally they would be transparent.
