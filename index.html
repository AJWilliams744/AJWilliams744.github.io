        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
            I am focused on enhancing human-computer interfaces and creating seamless user experiences through
            technology. With expertise in programming, 3D modeling, and effects, I’ve developed and released the game
            "Duck Life 9," which received an 89% positive rating on Steam. My work at Wix Games has involved designing
            and implementing complex gameplay elements, AI, and UI using Unity (C#), demonstrating my commitment to
            developing intuitive and engaging applications. <br> <br>

            In addition to my work in game development, I’ve contributed to software engineering projects at AIDA
            Intelligent Solutions and Nikon Metrology, where I created and maintained C# applications and enhanced X-ray
            software features. My industrial placement at OR3D allowed me to develop commercial 3D applications for VR
            and stereoscopic viewing, working with major clients in the automotive and engineering industries. I hold a
            BEng in Computer Science from York University and have continued to expand my skills through advanced
            courses in 3D animation and VFX. I am eager to bring my experience and creativity to new challenges in the
            tech world.
